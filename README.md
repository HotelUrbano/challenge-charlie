# Weather forecast

## The project

* The project aims to show the current temperature of the city you want and the forecast for the next two days.
* With the option of viewing the temperature in fahrenheit or celsius, just clicking on the desired unit.


## Runnning the project

* Need to have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
* `git clone https://github.com/morenolaforet/weather-forecast.git`
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the project with `npm start`
* Running in localhost:8080
* As the project is running on localhost we have problems with bing api CORS to get the image for background, so for it to be done one of the options * to solve the project is to install the [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) and add on the URL https://bing.com/ start the extension.
